# Module 6 - Context Engineering: Advanced AI Communication

Context engineering is the practice of **designing, structuring, and managing the broader environment** in which a large language model (LLM) processes information, not just the direct prompt.
While prompt engineering focuses on *how you phrase the instruction*, context engineering focuses on *what additional information surrounds and informs that instruction*.
It is sometimes called *“prompt engineering on steroids”* because it moves beyond single instructions into **systematic control of the model’s cognitive environment**.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Define **Context Engineering** and explain its importance in guiding AI behavior and output quality.  
- Identify key components that shape AI context, including **role**, **audience**, **purpose**, **tone**, and **constraints**.  
- Design prompts that embed clear contextual cues to improve relevance, coherence, and ethical alignment.  
- Distinguish between **explicit** and **implicit** context in human–AI interaction.  
- Apply context engineering techniques to achieve desired outcomes across different domains and use cases.  
- Reflect on how context influences meaning, interpretation, and responsibility in AI-generated content.  

## 6.1 Why Context Matters?

LLMs generate answers based purely on the **input context window**: the prompt plus any surrounding data you provide.  
By carefully shaping this context, you can:
- **Bias the model toward desired outcomes**  
- **Reduce hallucination** by grounding responses in authoritative sources  
- **Adapt the model to specific roles**  
- **Create repeatable workflows** for consistency  

## 6.2 Key Techniques in Context Engineering

1. **System Role Design** – Define the AI’s persona or purpose.  
2. **Instruction Layering** – Combine multiple prompt patterns.  
3. **Contextual Priming** – Provide reference materials or examples.  
4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Dynamically inject external data.  
5. **Chained Prompts** – Break complex tasks into stages.  
6. **Output Shaping** – Specify desired tone, style, or format.
7. **Negative Context Engineering** – Explicitly define what should be avoided or excluded.
8. **Multi-Modal Context Orchestration** – Combine text, structured data, and other input types when available. 

## 6.3 Prompt vs Context Engineering

| Aspect        | Prompt Engineering              | Context Engineering                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Focus         | Wording of instruction          | Full environment around the instruction         |
| Scope         | Single prompt                   | Multi-layered input, documents, workflows       |
| Goal          | Better single response          | Consistent, domain-specific high-quality outputs|
| Analogy       | Writing a recipe                | Designing the entire kitchen and pantry setup   |

## 6.4 Example in Education and Learning

**Prompt Engineering Example:**  
```
Summarize this lesson plan in three bullet points.
```

**Context Engineering Example:**  
```
System Role: You are an instructional designer specializing in technology-enhanced learning.

Reference Context: Here are three sample lesson plans from previous AI Literacy workshops [INSERT OR UPLOAD CONTENT].

Task: Evaluate the following lesson plan. Compare it to the reference cases and summarize in three bullet points.

Output: Provide a structured table with Strengths, Weaknesses, and Improvement Suggestions.
```

By embedding **role, reference materials, task, and output format**, the model produces more reliable and actionable results.

## 6.5 Example in Healthcare

**Prompt Engineering Example:** 
```
Summarize this patient case in three bullet points.
```

**Context Engineering Example:**  
```
System Role: You are a clinical data analyst supporting a hospital’s quality-improvement team.

Reference Context and Task: Review the following anonymized patient summary and compare it to current treatment guidelines provided in the reference file.

Output: Present your response in three bullet points organized under: Key Findings, Potential Risks, and Recommended Next Steps.
```

This demonstrates how adding context transforms a basic summarization task into a guided, responsible, and domain-specific analysis—producing output aligned with medical standards and professional use.

## Exercise 1: From Prompt Engineering to Context Engineering

**Part A – Prompt Engineering (Baseline)**  
Use a simple prompt to complete the task below:
```
Summarize the following startup idea in three bullet points:

Startup Idea: An AI-powered platform that helps local farmers predict crop diseases using satellite images and weather data.
```

**Part B – Context Engineering (Enhanced)**  
Expand the same task into a **context-engineered input** by adding:  
1. **System Role**  
2. **Reference Material**  
3. **Instruction Layering**  
4. **Output Shaping**  

*Example:*  
```
System Role: You are a venture capital analyst specializing in AgriTech startups.

Reference Context: Farmers face billions in losses annually due to crop diseases. Satellite-based solutions are an emerging trend in precision agriculture.

Task: Summarize the following startup idea. Compare it to typical AgriTech innovations and highlight market potential.

Startup Idea: An AI-powered platform that helps local farmers predict crop diseases using satellite images and weather data.

Output: Provide three bullet points under the headings:
- Value Proposition
- Market Fit
- Investment Potential
```

**Your Task:**  
1. Write your own **context-engineered version** of the baseline prompt.  
2. Compare the two outputs (baseline vs. context-engineered).  
3. Reflect: *What improvements did context engineering bring to the AI’s response?*

## 6.6 Personalized Assistants and Projects: Extending the GenAI Toolkit

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity and Claude provide powerful **general-purpose intelligence**, but professionals often need **domain-specific capabilities**. 
Two recent innovations — **Personalized Assistants** and **Projects** — enable you to move beyond using AI *as-is* and start **building tailored AI solutions**.

### 6.6.1 Personalized Assistants

**What are they?**  
Personalized assistants, such as *Custom GPTs* are personalized versions of foundational models (like GPT-4/5) that you configure with **specific instructions, data, and tools**. 
Think of them as your own AI partner that understands the context of your business.
