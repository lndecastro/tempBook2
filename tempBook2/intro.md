# Welcome to "AI Literacy" — The Future-Ready Journey

Welcome to the **AI Literacy Program**, part of the **FGCU AI Academy** led by the **Dendritic Institute for Human-Centered AI & Data Science** at Florida Gulf Coast University. The **AI Literacy Program** is the *foundational offering* of the **FGCU AI Academy**, designed as a gentle introduction to the world of Artificial Intelligence for learners from all backgrounds. As the first in a series of Academy programs, it helps students, professionals, and community members build a common understanding of what AI is, how it works, and how it is transforming everyday life. Through accessible examples and human-centered discussion, participants learn to navigate the opportunities and challenges of AI with curiosity, confidence, and critical thinking — setting the stage for deeper technical and applied studies in subsequent Academy pathways. This Jupyter Book is designed to be your **interactive guide** through the world of Artificial Intelligence — from its origins and foundations to the basics of Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Program Goals

The goal of this program is to **equip learners with enough understanding to confidently use and critically evaluate Generative AI tools**. By the end of this journey, you will:

- Understand what AI is, where it came from, and where it is heading.  
- Recognize the main **branches, paradigms, and learning strategies** that underpin modern AI.  
- Develop awareness of how AI systems are built, trained, and applied responsibly.  
- Gain fluency in **Generative AI tools**, **prompt engineering**, and **context design**.  
- Learn to assess AI outputs with a **critical, human-centered mindset**.  

Whether you are a student, professional, or community member, this program provides the foundation to engage meaningfully with AI in your field.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this program, you will be able to:
- Describe the **historical evolution of AI** and its key milestones.  
- Explain the **core concepts** of machine learning, data, and model training.  
- Distinguish between different **AI terminologies** — computational intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, etc.  
- Experiment with **Generative AI and LLMs**, understanding how they are used to create content.  
- Apply **prompt engineering** techniques to guide AI outputs effectively.  
- Design **context-aware interactions** that align AI responses with purpose, audience, and ethics.  
- Reflect on **real-world use cases** evaluating both potential and limitations.  

## Our Journey

AI Literacy is structured as a **progressive learning pathway**, blending history, concepts, and practice.  
Each module builds on the previous one — guiding you from “What is AI?” to “How can I work with it responsibly?”

| Module | Theme | Focus |

| **1** | *A Brief History of AI* | From the dawn of computing to the present, tracing AI’s evolution across decades. |
| **2** | *What is AI and Its Many Branches* | Exploring the diverse approaches — machine learning, neural networks, natural computing, data science, etc. |
| **3** | *How Machines Learn* | Understanding learning paradigms and strategies that power intelligent systems. |
| **4** | *Generative AI & Large Language Models* | Unpacking how GenAI systems and LLMs create new content and simulate reasoning. |
| **5** | *Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering* | Learning to communicate effectively with AI through structured prompting. |
| **6** | *Context Engineering* | Setting the right stage for AI: audience, purpose, tone, and ethical framing. |
| **7** | *Foundational Models and Tools* | Surveying some key AI frameworks, platforms, and copilots. |
| **8** | *Sample Use Cases* | Examining practical applications across domains. |

## Human-Centered AI

This program embraces a **human-centered approach** to AI:  
AI is not replacing people — it is amplifying our capacity to think, create, and solve.  
As you advance through these modules, keep reflecting on:

> How can AI become a partner in human learning, creativity, critical-thinking, and problem-solving?
